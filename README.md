# contactinfo 
This is my attempt at applying linked list to real world scenerios

Skills used: Linked List, Dynamic Allocation, Struct Application.

This program presents the user with a menu which allows the user to chose from various options:
add contact info
remove contact info
edit contact info
print contact info
store contact info (writes the info into a file)
load contact info (read info from the same file into a list)
After chosing, using linked list it will replicate a phone book like application that can allow the user 
to do all of the above.
